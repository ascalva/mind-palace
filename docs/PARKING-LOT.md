# PARKING-LOT — the centralized parked-decision dependency registry

**What this is.** One place to see every *parked* decision, its *home* (the note/section it was
parked in), its *status*, what it *depends on*, and its *re-entry trigger* — so following a chain of
"this waits on that, which waits on the other" no longer means grepping lettered sections across a dozen
notes. Orchestrator-maintained (single-writer, like `docs/PROGRESS.md`).

**Maintenance discipline (binding).** Update this file whenever a decision is **parked** (add a row),
**unparked / implemented** (flip status, keep the row — the history is the value), or **its dependency
changes**. Do it at every `/triage` and at every graduation that touches a parked item. Each row's
`Home` is the authoritative source; this registry is the *index + the edges*, never a replacement for the
note's own reasoning.

**Can Ouroboros answer this instead? Not yet — and the gap is instructive.** bp-035's `ReferenceView`
queries the reference graph at **document grain** (`note-A → note-B`). Parked items live *below* that
grain (a *row* inside a note) and their dependencies are *prose* ("re-entry = TA-b's gate"), which the
sensor does **not** mint as edges. So this hand-maintained registry is **v0**. **v1** is to make parked
decisions *first-class typed entities* with minted `depends_on` edges — then a `DecisionView` (the next
resolution down from `ReferenceView`) answers "what does ML-a wait on?" live. v1 is a real graduation on
the reference/query arc; this file is its seed (the schema below is deliberately edge-first so it ports).

**Status legend.** `parked` (waiting on a trigger) · `active` (being worked) · `ready` (trigger met,
graduatable) · `built` (implemented) · `resolved` (a decision, settled — no build) · `open-owner`
(awaits an owner ruling) · `superseded`.

**Coverage.** SEEDED (2026-07-15) with the **query / edge-dynamics / magnetic / reference cluster** —
the tangle currently in play. Other clusters (effectors/Track G, dreaming, sensing, secrets, voice,
etc.) are swept in incrementally at `/triage`; a `⋯` at the end of a section marks "more to harvest."

## Registry

`id` uses the note's native label where one exists (ML-a, TA-b, PD-c…); orchestrator-assigned ids
(CQ-*, DD-*, VF-*, R*) are marked. `→ X` in **Depends on** is another row's id; **(ext)** is a
non-decision condition (data accretion, an owner ruling, the Fable cap).

### Algebra — `core/temporal` / `dn-temporal-retrieval-algebra`
| id | item | home | status | depends on | re-entry / trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| A8 | β\* (kernel-representability loss point) | TRA §2.6 | **resolved** | — | (theorem; computable, bp-026) |
| TA-a | weighted vs combinatorial inner products (the magnetic `L^{(q)}` upgrade) | TRA parked (= PD-b) | parked | → PD-b | the metric-coherence tier (Result 4) is built, OR PD-b's 2nd customer is proposed |
| TA-b | the `(β,z)` z-resolution dial | TRA parked | parked | (ext) a retrieval eval set | an eval set gives z a falsifier |
| TA-c | homotopy-coherent (diamond) superconnection `τ_k` | TRA parked | parked | → MAG-census | measured fork/merge **diamond frequency** warrants the rigor |
| CQ-wire | wire `core/temporal` **single-snapshot** (X_cite β₁ threads) into a live read surface = `TemporalView` | CQ §3 / TRA | **built** (bp-037 sealed `1a7be36`, 2026-07-15; live β₁=24 @ HEAD) | → TA-d (built) | (done) |
| CQ-wire-2 | wire `core/temporal` **two-snapshot** (`‖[d,τ]‖` citation-coherence, `σ_*`, poset `δ_D²=0`) into `TemporalView` | CQ §3 / TRA | **built** (bp-038 sealed, 2026-07-15; live ‖[d,τ]‖=0 flat 3797f8b→177b7fd) | → CQ-wire (bp-037, built) | (done). σ = restrict-to-common (§3 Q1). finding-0082 = VersionStore enumerator gap (poset scoped to corpus nodes). **`core/temporal` FULLY WIRED — "complete the algebra" DONE** |

| CQ-mode1b | Mode-1b soft diffusion + the `K_struct ⊙ K_sem` hybrid | CQ §2.2; **re-warranted** `velocity-and-clocks-fable-pass` T6 | parked (T6, owner coda 2026-07-15: this is the INTRINSIC retrieval geometry — cosine is only the local metric; K(β) at finite β = the honest geodesic; the T3 J-weighted α-deformation extends it) | → CQ-ref, (ext) kernel machinery | a ranking customer + eval set (unchanged) |

### Diachronic dreamer — `dn-core-query-protocol` §2.7 / Lane B
| id | item | home | status | depends on | re-entry / trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DD-1 | **diachronic interpreter — corpus-structural tier** (over `X_cite`, mirror-safe) | CQ §2.7 | **ready** | → TA-d (built), → A7, → CQ-wire | owner-directed (roadmap #3); the lens contract + A7 discriminator |

| PD-e | first potential V for gradient-flow fits (Dirichlet default) | ED §4 | parked | → R4 | R4 entry |
| PD-f | THREAD claim narration weighting | ED §4 | parked | → L-b | dreamer-quality evidence it needs distinct adjudication |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MAG-census | arrow-aware **combinatorial** census (SCC/directed-cycles, unbalanced diamonds, retro-citations) | MAG §3 item 2 | **ran (one-off 2026-07-15)** | — (licensed, rides Thread-C) | permanent-lens deferred → DD-1, or a cleaner per-commit census |

| MAG-own3 | covering-only `supersedes:` as a checked A6 invariant | MAG owner-dec-3 | **open-owner** | — | owner ruling (rec: adopt; near-zero cost; keeps the Hasse DAG triangle-free) |

### Vector-field candidates — `docs/brainstorms/edge-dynamics-vector-field.md` (~mine, fable-grade)
| id | item | home | status | depends on | re-entry / trigger |

| VF-residual | prediction-residual = live creative signal | brainstorm; **formalized** pass V6 | parked (formalized: Kalman innovations; by TRA R6 supported on injection events; **provenance-decomposable r_owner + r_dreamer by construction** — demon-vs-source now a specified experiment; attribution design rides DD-1's charter) | → R3, → R4 | the evolution operator is fit |

### External conditions (not decisions — the roots the chains hang from)
- **(ext) sample depth** — data accretion over commits; the root of the whole R-ladder + every VF-*.
  The corpus is YOUNG (2026-07-15 census: 234 distinct doc→doc pairs / 113 nodes) — likely below R1's
  honest-CV threshold today.
- **(ext) a retrieval eval set** — roots TA-b, ML-c, CQ-mode1b. Note CQ-selfgrade (bp-035's oracle)
  *bootstraps* a structural eval set; a *directed-ranking* eval set is a further step.
- **(ext) Fable weekly cap** — resets **Jul 17 8pm ET** (currently 100% used). **Largely
  discharged early**: CQ-scope AND every VF-* formalization AND the temporal-clocks fable items
  (T1 causal-set, T2 locally-clocked superconnection def+reduction, T3 conformal repairs, T4
  driven-dissipative, T5 unification candidate) all cleared 2026-07-15 on **usage credits**
  (`cq-scope-fable-pass.md` + `velocity-and-clocks-fable-pass.md`). Remaining genuinely
  fable-gated: T2's full gauge theory + T5's proof — but both are DATA-gated first (version
  depth), so no fable unit is currently blocked on the cap.
- **SS-substrate** — `dn-self-sensing` B-a (interpreter-version supersession) + B-b (`AgentObservationStore`
  + φ_self). Roots DD-2 / Lane B. (Build-state to verify at /triage.)

**Reading it:** almost the entire *dynamics/velocity* half hangs off one external root — **sample depth**
(the R-ladder) — which the young corpus likely hasn't cleared. The *magnetic operator* half hangs off a
**retrieval eval set** + the **census** (ran; gate iii not met). The *reference/query* half is the only
one with roots already satisfied (`core/temporal` + `ReferenceView` are built) — which is why the owner's
roadmap starts there.

## Owner roadmap (2026-07-15) — sequenced onto the graph

The owner directed, in order: **(1) complete the algebra → (2) create (if possible) a unified query
language → (3) the diachronic dreamer tier**, and RULED (2026-07-15) the concrete session sequencing:

- **SESSION N+1 — build the algebra = `CQ-wire`.** "Complete the algebra" is settled = **wire the BUILT
  `core/temporal` (X_cite + operators: β₁ threads, `‖[d,τ]‖` citation-coherence) into its first live
  consumer** — it is built but wired to nothing (only tests import it). Opus, **no fable** needed. The
  *gated* upgrades (TA-a magnetic, TA-c diamond, the metric-coherence tier Result 4) are NOT part of
  this — they stay parked behind their eval-set / sample-depth / census-evidence triggers.
  → **GRADUATED 2026-07-15**: the built surface bifurcates by data shape, so `CQ-wire` split into
  **`bp-037`** (single-snapshot — β₁ threads via a commit-anchored `TemporalView`, `proposed`, awaits
  owner bless) + **`CQ-wire-2`** (two-snapshot `‖[d,τ]‖` coherence, gated on bp-037 so its upstream
  interface is built-not-inferred; open σ-resolution design settles in its own grounded pass). The
  owner may override at the bless gate and ask for both halves in one session.
- **SESSION N+2 — a FABLE session = `CQ-scope`** (the §2.1 capability-scope type system — all Views as
  one bounded-lattice scope algebra = the unified query language). Design largely settled in CQ §2.1
  (fable-vetted); the fable session formalizes + the build follows.
  → **DONE 2026-07-15** (early — ran on **usage credits**, owner-directed, not waiting for the Jul-17
  reset): fable pass `brainstorms/cq-scope-fable-pass.md` (S1–S8) + **`dn-capability-scope` drafted**.
  Awaits owner ratification; then `/graduate` mints the one scope-layer build plan (Opus, no fable).
- **SESSION N+3+ — the diachronic dreamer = `DD-1`** (corpus-structural tier over X_cite). **Depends on
  `CQ-wire`** (consumes the wired algebra) + `A7` + the lens contract → naturally follows the algebra
  build. `DD-2` (observed-plane weaving / Track D) waits on the self-sensing substrate + sample depth.

Dependency-soundness: **1 → 3 is a true edge** (`CQ-wire ► DD-1`); **2 is a home, not a hard blocker**
for 3 (DD-1 could ship as a lens then re-home into the scope algebra). The owner's order holds.
