# PARKING-LOT — the centralized parked-decision dependency registry

**What this is.** One place to see every *parked* decision, its *home* (the note/section it was
parked in), its *status*, what it *depends on*, and its *re-entry trigger* — so following a chain of
"this waits on that, which waits on the other" no longer means grepping lettered sections across a dozen
notes. Orchestrator-maintained (single-writer, like `docs/PROGRESS.md`).

**Maintenance discipline (binding).** Update this file whenever a decision is **parked** (add a row),
**unparked / implemented** (flip status, keep the row — the history is the value), or **its dependency
changes**. Do it at every `/triage` and at every graduation that touches a parked item. Each row's
`Home` is the authoritative source; this registry is the *index + the edges*, never a replacement for the
note's own reasoning.

**Can Ouroboros answer this instead? Not yet — and the gap is instructive.** bp-035's `ReferenceView`
queries the reference graph at **document grain** (`note-A → note-B`). Parked items live *below* that
grain (a *row* inside a note) and their dependencies are *prose* ("re-entry = TA-b's gate"), which the
sensor does **not** mint as edges. So this hand-maintained registry is **v0**. **v1** is to make parked
decisions *first-class typed entities* with minted `depends_on` edges — then a `DecisionView` (the next
resolution down from `ReferenceView`) answers "what does ML-a wait on?" live. v1 is a real graduation on
the reference/query arc; this file is its seed (the schema below is deliberately edge-first so it ports).

**Status legend.** `parked` (waiting on a trigger) · `active` (being worked) · `ready` (trigger met,
graduatable) · `built` (implemented) · `resolved` (a decision, settled — no build) · `open-owner`
(awaits an owner ruling) · `superseded`.

**Coverage.** SEEDED (2026-07-15) with the **query / edge-dynamics / magnetic / reference cluster** —
the tangle currently in play. Other clusters (effectors/Track G, dreaming, sensing, secrets, voice,
etc.) are swept in incrementally at `/triage`; a `⋯` at the end of a section marks "more to harvest."

## Registry

`id` uses the note's native label where one exists (ML-a, TA-b, PD-c…); orchestrator-assigned ids
(CQ-*, DD-*, VF-*, R*) are marked. `→ X` in **Depends on** is another row's id; **(ext)** is a
non-decision condition (data accretion, an owner ruling, the Fable cap).

| id | item | home | status | depends on | re-entry / trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MAG-census | arrow-aware **combinatorial** census (SCC/directed-cycles, unbalanced diamonds, retro-citations) | MAG §3 item 2 | **ran (one-off 2026-07-15)** | — (licensed, rides Thread-C) | permanent-lens deferred → DD-1, or a cleaner per-commit census |

| MAG-own3 | covering-only `supersedes:` as a checked A6 invariant | MAG owner-dec-3 | **open-owner** | — | owner ruling (rec: adopt; near-zero cost; keeps the Hasse DAG triangle-free) |

### Vector-field candidates — `docs/brainstorms/edge-dynamics-vector-field.md` (~mine, fable-grade)
| id | item | home | status | depends on | re-entry / trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### External conditions (not decisions — the roots the chains hang from)
- **(ext) sample depth** — data accretion over commits; the root of the whole R-ladder + every VF-*.
  The corpus is YOUNG (2026-07-15 census: 234 distinct doc→doc pairs / 113 nodes) — likely below R1's
  honest-CV threshold today.
- **(ext) a retrieval eval set** — roots TA-b, ML-c, CQ-mode1b. Note CQ-selfgrade (bp-035's oracle)
  *bootstraps* a structural eval set; a *directed-ranking* eval set is a further step.
- **(ext) Fable weekly cap** — resets **Jul 17 8pm ET** (currently 100% used). Gates the *formalization*
  of CQ-scope + every VF-*.
- **SS-substrate** — `dn-self-sensing` B-a (interpreter-version supersession) + B-b (`AgentObservationStore`
  + φ_self). Roots DD-2 / Lane B. (Build-state to verify at /triage.)

**Reading it:** almost the entire *dynamics/velocity* half hangs off one external root — **sample depth**
(the R-ladder) — which the young corpus likely hasn't cleared. The *magnetic operator* half hangs off a
**retrieval eval set** + the **census** (ran; gate iii not met). The *reference/query* half is the only
one with roots already satisfied (`core/temporal` + `ReferenceView` are built) — which is why the owner's
roadmap starts there.

## Owner roadmap (2026-07-15) — sequenced onto the graph

The owner directed, in order: **(1) complete the algebra → (2) create (if possible) a unified query
language → (3) the diachronic dreamer tier.** Mapped to readiness:

1. **Complete the algebra.** The algebra's *math* is done (ratified) and `core/temporal` is *built* but
   **wired to nothing** (only tests import it). The ready, actionable "completion" is **`CQ-wire`** — give
   X_cite + the operators (β₁ threads, `‖[d,τ]‖` citation-coherence) their **first live consumer**. The
   *gated* upgrades (TA-a magnetic, TA-c diamond, the metric-coherence tier) are NOT cleanly available —
   they root on an eval set / sample depth / census-evidence not yet present. **⚠ clarify with owner:**
   "complete the algebra" = wire the built algebra live (ready now), or pursue the gated upgrades (blocked)?
2. **Unified query language = `CQ-scope`** (the §2.1 capability-scope type system — all Views as one
   bounded-lattice scope algebra). **Fable-grade design** → the formalization wants the **Jul-17 Fable
   reset**; then a build. "if possible" is apt: it's the hardest piece, but its design is largely settled
   in CQ §2.1 (fable-vetted). This is the clean typed *home* the diachronic dreamer would then plug into.
3. **Diachronic dreamer tier = `DD-1`** (corpus-structural, over X_cite). **Depends on `CQ-wire`** (it
   consumes the wired algebra) + `A7` (the discriminator) + the lens contract — so it naturally *follows*
   step 1, exactly as sequenced. `DD-2` (the observed-plane weaving / Track D) waits on the self-sensing
   substrate + sample depth, later.

Dependency-soundness check: **1 → 3 is a true edge** (`CQ-wire ► DD-1`); **2 is a home, not a hard
blocker** for 3 (DD-1 can ship as a lens before the scope type system, then be re-homed). So the owner's
order is right, with one option: 2 and 3 can swap or parallelize since 2 is fable-gated and 3 is ready
once 1 lands.
