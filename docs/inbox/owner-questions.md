# Owner questions

The one file the owner answers. Orchestrator-maintained (`/triage` batches
routed `design | math | direction` findings here; never dripped). Each entry
carries a `default_if_unanswered` with a **park condition**, so an unanswered
question degrades to a parked item with a re-entry — never a stalled builder (§10).

To answer: edit the entry's `answer:` line and flip `status: open → answered`.
`/triage` then sweeps the answer back to its origin artifact and marks it `swept`.

Entry shape: `status`, `origin`, `blocking` (bool), `question`, `default_if_unanswered`
(with park), `answer`.

## oq-0001 — Should CLAUDE.md re-home any of the pre-BP-000 domain digest?
- status: swept
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0001.md
- blocking: false
- question: BP-000 replaced the pre-BP-000 CLAUDE.md (mind-palace operating rules)
  with the persona-neutral workflow constitution, keeping only a pointer to the
  domain layer (`CONSTITUTION.md` / `BUILD-SPEC.md` / `CONVENTIONS.md`). Dropped
  from the auto-loaded surface: the 12-item non-negotiables digest, the repo map,
  the "current phase" marker, and the live-verification directive. All remain in
  `BUILD-SPEC.md` / `CONVENTIONS.md` / git history. Do you want any of that digest
  re-homed into the constitution (which costs tokens every turn), or is the
  pointer sufficient?
- default_if_unanswered: pointer-only stands (workflow constitution stays lean per
  §5). Parks as finding-0001; re-entry — owner answers here, or a `direction`
  finding reports a session missing dropped context.
- answer: Re-home the **safety-critical non-negotiables digest** (only). Ratified as
  amendment A2 (warrant: finding-0001): §5 now exempts the domain bright-line digest
  from the constitution thinness rule — an out-of-context guardrail is not a
  guardrail, so it stays inline in the always-loaded body, not behind a pointer. The
  *other* dropped items (repo map, current-phase marker, live-verify directive) are
  operational context, not guardrails, and stay pointer-only per §5 — they remain in
  `BUILD-SPEC.md` / `CONVENTIONS.md` / git history. Landed by bp-001 in CLAUDE.md.

## oq-0002 — Fold bp-002 and bp-003 into the formal lifecycle (`complete`), or leave held at `proposed`?
- status: swept
- origin: docs/PROGRESS.md — the standing "Owner-pending (non-blocking)" lifecycle decision
  recorded in the bp-002 note (2026-07-05) and the bp-003 note (2026-07-06, backfilled)
- blocking: false
- question: bp-002 (amendment A3) and bp-003 (amendment A4) each landed and committed under owner
  authority but never took the owner-only `proposed → ready` blessing, so both sit at
  `status: proposed` while their work is terminal — a split board against bp-000/bp-001/bp-004
  (`complete`). Fold both into the formal `ready → in-progress → complete` lifecycle to match
  bp-004, or leave them held at `proposed` as landed-but-unblessed?
- default_if_unanswered: leave held at `proposed` (the recorded state); re-entry — owner rules
  here, or a `direction` finding reports the split board causing confusion.
- answer: **FOLD BOTH TO `complete`, matching bp-004 — uniform board, no drift** (owner ruling,
  2026-07-06). Enactment respects the blessing gate: the **owner** supplies the missing
  `proposed → ready` blessing by hand on `docs/build-plans/bp-002/plan.md` and
  `docs/build-plans/bp-003/plan.md` (owner-only, never in-session, §10); the **orchestrator** then
  flips `ready → complete`, seals each journal, and writes the PROGRESS checkpoints. An agent
  `proposed → complete` shortcut is deliberately NOT used — it would bypass the readiness gate
  (see finding-0009). bp-002's §14-parked pre-hoc `status: ready` denylist is a separate item,
  unaffected. Swept into the combined bp-002 + bp-003 seal checkpoint (`docs/PROGRESS.md`, 2026-07-06).

## oq-0003 — Ratify amendment A7: gate the *egress* from `proposed`, not just entry to `ready`?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0009.md
- blocking: false
- question: `gate-guard`'s `cmd_gate_check` denies only two destination values — a note `→ ratified`
  and a plan `→ ready` — by exact equality on the *new* status. Every other value falls through to
  ALLOW, so an agent editing a plan `proposed → in-progress` (or `→ complete`) directly reaches a
  build-implying state **without the owner's `proposed → ready` blessing ever occurring**. Same
  failure family as finding-0005/0006 (a bright line an ordinary edit silently bypasses). The finding
  proposes **A7**: gate the egress — deny an agent transition *into* `in-progress`/`complete` unless
  the on-disk `cur` is a legitimate predecessor (`in-progress` requires `cur ∈ {ready, in-progress}`;
  `complete` requires `cur == in-progress`), applied at `gate-guard` **and** both Stop-gate paths for
  A5 parity. Ratify A7 (owner-only, §10) so a builder can land the `_lib.py` change (as bp-002/bp-004
  did for prior amendments), or decline? The exact predecessor table is your ratification call; the
  finding names only the hole and direction.
- default_if_unanswered: A7 unratified; the hole stands (mitigated only by convention — the orchestrator
  never uses a `proposed → complete` shortcut, per oq-0002's enactment). Parks as finding-0009; re-entry —
  owner ratifies here, or a `direction` finding reports an ungated `proposed → {in-progress,complete}`
  flip actually occurring.

## oq-0004 — Refresh the stale self-status on the BUILT & WIRED design-note cohort?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0010.md
- blocking: false
- question: A cohort of design notes carry self-status ("design only" / "not implemented" / "DRAFT —
  pending reconciliation") that understates code which is built, tested, and in several cases wired:
  `verdict-authority.md`, `vault-runtime-auth.md`, `skills-and-scope.md`, `attestation-layer.md`,
  `the-edge-model.md`, `the-sacred-boundary.md` (details + proposed completed-format front-matter in
  `docs/audits/corpus-state-audit-2026-07.md` §4). Because `/graduate` refuses any note not `ratified`,
  these cannot advance until their status is corrected **by hand at the blessing gate** (owner-only,
  §10 — the design-note surface is owner-gated even for a builder). Apply the audit §4 front-matter to
  this cohort? **Interaction:** bp-005 (in-progress) prepends *missing* front-matter at `status: draft`
  and explicitly never writes `ratified`; it targets notes *lacking* front-matter, disjoint from this
  cohort (which has stale-but-present status) — so the two do not collide, and `ratified` stays your
  hand in both.
- default_if_unanswered: the cohort keeps its stale status and stays ungraduatable. Parks as finding-0010;
  re-entry — owner applies the §4 status by hand, or a `/graduate` attempt is blocked by a stale
  non-`ratified` status on a note whose work is done.

## oq-0005 — Apply the edge/supersession note↔code reconciliations (incl. the drafted `recursive-strata-amendment`)?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0013.md
- blocking: false
- question: Five citation-verified note/plan↔code contradictions in the edge/supersession area, several
  on load-bearing (Invariant-2-adjacent) partition claims: (1) `the-edge-model.md` §3 presents assertion
  authority as a per-edge typed field that doesn't exist — Item 7 realized it as store-identity; (2)
  `recursive-strata.md:45` cites a `SUPERSEDES` rel-type that was **removed** ("Do not re-add") — exactly
  the fix the already-drafted `recursive-strata-amendment.md` §1 makes, still unapplied; (3) "EdgeStore
  refuses supersedes" (edge plan + `build.py:149`) is literally false — the store accepts any `rel_type`;
  the real protection is *no writer + no handle* (sound, tested), so the wording invites a future edit to
  rely on a guarantee that isn't there; (4)(5) two stale status/tracking lines. Ratify+apply the drafted
  `recursive-strata-amendment.md` (§1/§5) and reconcile the three wordings at the blessing gate
  (owner-only — all fall on denylisted design-note/plan surfaces)? Item (5) alone (the `DERIVED_STRATUM`
  PROGRESS line) is orchestrator-writable and is being corrected in this triage's checkpoint.
- default_if_unanswered: the contradictions persist; the "store refuses" overclaim remains a latent hazard
  (a future edit could lean on a guard that isn't there). Parks as finding-0013; re-entry — owner applies
  the edits, or a builder relies on the false "EdgeStore refuses" guarantee.

## oq-0006 — Close the Invariant-2 import-firewall asymmetry and confirm which CI enforces it?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0014.md
- blocking: false
- question: Invariant 2 ("network and private data never share a component; only `edge/` touches the
  network, never the vault") is enforced structurally by `ops/import_lint.py`, but asymmetrically:
  **core → edge/network** is comprehensively linted (test + a dedicated GitHub CI job), while
  **edge → core/vault** has no blanket static lint (only `edge/effectors/**` is narrowly barred; nothing
  stops `edge/interface`, `edge/monitor`, `edge/bridge` from importing `core`). Separately, `.gitlab-ci.yml`
  runs SAST/secret-detection/semantic-release but **no `import-firewall` job** — so if GitLab is
  authoritative, structural enforcement of this non-negotiable rides solely on the pytest integrity gate.
  Rule on: (a) add a `scan_edge` mirror barring `edge → core/vault` (the thinner-net, private-data-leak
  direction), and (b) which CI host is canonical + ensure `import-firewall` runs there (add to
  `.gitlab-ci.yml`, or confirm GitHub Actions is authoritative)? May graduate to a small builder task once
  ruled.
- default_if_unanswered: the one-directional lint stands; the edge→vault direction stays covered only by
  the pytest integrity gate on whichever host runs it. Parks as finding-0014; re-entry — owner rules, or
  an `edge/` module importing `core`/vault slips past because the authoritative CI didn't run the lint.

## oq-0007 — Give the tracking surfaces an explicit *built vs deployed vs wired* distinction (a wiring board)?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0020.md (umbrella; facets: finding-0011, -0012, -0015, -0016, -0019)
- blocking: false
- question: Across the corpus, "complete" consistently means *built/deployed*, not *wired-into-the-live-loop*,
  but the terse summary surfaces (`CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, the archive Phase-10 roll-up) don't carry that
  distinction, so a reader materially overestimates the running system. Code-verified overclaims: "Phase 8
  Complete / research airlock (live)" — no live driver (finding-0019); "Vault Production … to access cloud" —
  nothing consumes Vault on the daemon; "WIRED ceiling ε = SENSING" — no effector wired at any tier
  (finding-0011); drift gauge A1 "keystone COMPLETE" — inert live, only the boot-time fingerprint conjunct
  runs (finding-0015); execution/agency substrate present but undriven (finding-0016); supersession/dialogue
  machinery dormant (finding-0012). The current `docs/PROGRESS.md` is itself honest/self-correcting; the
  overclaim lives in the summaries. Each of those findings offers an "OR annotate as dormant/not-wired" cheap
  path — this question is that shared decision. Introduce an explicit **built / deployed / wired** distinction
  — a dedicated wiring board, or annotate the summaries — and in what form? (The *building* of the missing
  drivers — Track D, A2, Item 8 — is normal roadmap sequencing, tracked separately, not this question.)
- default_if_unanswered: the summaries stay as-is; `docs/PROGRESS.md` remains the honest source and this
  triage's checkpoint records the specific overclaims in one place, but CHANGELOG/README still read as
  "wired." Parks as finding-0020 (with 0011/0012/0015/0016/0019 folded); re-entry — owner picks the
  annotation form, or a reader/agent is again misled by a summary surface.

## oq-0008 — The research airlock: give it a design record, wire-or-defer its driver, and rule on the ahead-of-code Vault provisioning?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0019.md
- blocking: false
- question: The research airlock (BUILD-SPEC §16) is a substantial built + tested + **AWS-deployed**
  subsystem spanning four tiers (`core/research/*`, `edge/bridge/*`, `cloud/fetcher/*`, `cloud/terraform/*`)
  that the 2026-07 corpus audit missed entirely (its cloud tier was outside the audit's scope —
  finding-0018). **Not wired:** `build_bridge` raises without `[airlock] s3_bucket` (unset here); nothing on
  the live path calls `emit`/`collect`/`rank_literature`; the `"research"` router-kind has no handler.
  Separately, `ops/vault/policies/{correlator,dreamer}.hcl` provision a Vault `correlator` role reading
  `oura-daily-aggregates` for a biometric pipeline that **has no implementation** — deployed access for code
  that doesn't exist yet (a latent surface). Rule on: (a) give the airlock a design note (or an explicit
  BUILD-SPEC §16 cross-reference in the corpus index) so it isn't invisible to future audits; (b) wire the
  live driver (`research_criteria → emit → bridge → collect → rank_literature`) or explicitly defer it with a
  re-entry marker; (c) whether the correlator/biometric Vault provisioning should precede its implementation.
- default_if_unanswered: the airlock stays deployed-but-undriven and unindexed, and the ahead-of-code Vault
  role stays provisioned. Parks as finding-0019; re-entry — owner rules (a)/(b)/(c), or the next corpus audit
  re-misses the subsystem for lack of a design record.

## oq-0009 — Catalogue or prune the orphan `docs/research/planar_graphs.md`?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0017.md
- blocking: false
- question: `docs/research/planar_graphs.md` is an external survey with **no implementation target** (grep for
  `planar|kuratowski|genus|planariz|fary|boyer|myrvold` across the source tree returns 0), is **not catalogued
  in `docs/README.md`** (which lists the other two research notes), and its "topology" framing name-collides
  with `core/complex/topology.py`, which implements a *different* body of math (persistent homology / Vietoris–
  Rips) — a genuine trip hazard given how central `core/complex/` is. Both research surveys are also statusless
  (no front-matter). Catalogue it in `docs/README.md` with an explicit "background reference, not a spec" line
  (as `un-represent-ability.md` already carries), or prune it? Optionally add minimal front-matter to both
  surveys for uniform headers. (bp-005 may add that front-matter under `docs/research/**` at `status: draft`;
  the catalogue-or-prune call is yours.)
- default_if_unanswered: the orphan stays uncatalogued with its name-colliding subject. Parks as finding-0017;
  re-entry — owner decides catalogue-or-prune.

## oq-0010 — Ratify the provisional research-note front-matter convention (template + spec line)?
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0023.md
- blocking: false
- question: bp-005 required front-matter on `docs/research/*.md`, but no research-note template or
  schema exists anywhere (`docs/templates/` covers design-note, build-plan, capsule, finding only;
  neither `BUILD-SPEC.md` nor `agent-workflow.md` defines a `type:`/id-prefix/field set for research
  notes). To complete without blocking (§5) the builder applied a **provisional convention** mirroring
  the design-note schema — `type: research`, `id: rn-<filename-slug>`, `status: draft`,
  `created`/`updated` from git history, `links: []`, `supersedes`/`superseded_by`/`warrant: null` —
  to the three research notes. Ratify it (add `docs/templates/research-note.md` + a line in the
  artifact-chain spec), amend it, or replace it? The three `rn-*` headers get a cheap reconciliation
  either way. **Secondary decision riding along:** for all 33 converted notes, `updated:` was set to
  each note's git last-commit date, not conversion date (a metadata-only migration shouldn't rewrite a
  note's recency) — confirm, or have it redone at the same cost.
  **Update 2026-07-10 (/triage):** the drift the finding predicted is already live — the new
  `docs/research/biometric-sensor-agent.md` (`38ccc85`) deviates from the provisional schema on three
  axes: `id:` lacks the `rn-` prefix, a novel `family:` field appears, and `created`/`updated` are
  absent (`supersedes: []` vs `null`). Each new research note without a ratified schema mints its own
  dialect; the reconciliation cost grows with every one.
- default_if_unanswered: the provisional convention stands, unratified. Parks as finding-0023;
  re-entry — owner ratifies/replaces here, or tooling starts keying on `type:`/id-prefix (the latent
  inconsistency the finding names).

## oq-0011 — Ratify amendment A8: replace the design-notes *location* denylist with a *status*-aware guard?
- status: swept
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0025.md
- blocking: false
- question: The foundation denylist bars `docs/design-notes/**` wholesale, so *draft* notes — unblessed
  working material, same trust class as a build plan — are unwritable by any agent, structurally
  destroying the brainstorm → draft note → graduate flow the orchestrator exists for. The invariant
  actually worth protecting is **status**, not location: ratified/superseded notes agent-immutable
  (content and status, laundering-proof); draft notes writable under normal `write_scope`;
  `draft → ratified` owner-only, unchanged. **bp-005 proved the defect live:** its legal conversion
  could land only via an owner temp-lift of the global deny (`d6e518f`) that was then restored
  (`f5d435d`) — a hand-operated bypass, and while open, a hole in the very ratified-record guarantee
  the denylist exists for. finding-0025 specifies the guard precisely, including the two non-obvious
  requirements: a **content guard** in `cmd_scope_check` (gate-guard ALLOWs body-only writes that touch
  no status line, so it alone cannot protect ratified *content*), and a **HEAD-keyed Stop-side check**
  (post-hoc, on-disk status is the laundered value — compare against committed status, as
  `_blessing_in_diff` already does). Helpers exist (`is_design_note`, `status_of`); the other three
  denylist entries are untouched. Ratify A8 so a builder lands the `_lib.py` change with the six-case
  regression harness (finding-0025 §Disposition item 4), or decline?
- default_if_unanswered: the location denylist stands; agent draft-note authoring remains impossible
  except by per-episode owner temp-lifts. Parks as finding-0025; re-entry — owner ratifies here, or
  the next legal draft-note task forces another temp-lift.
- answer: **RATIFIED as A8** (owner's hand: edits 1+2 committed `8a5131e`, edit 3 `a19e030`,
  2026-07-11) and **IMPLEMENTED** same day (bp-010, `4fe6ad4`): status-aware guard live —
  draft-writable, ratified/superseded agent-immutable, HEAD-keyed laundering-proof, 11/11
  acceptance. finding-0025 → promoted. Swept to origin same day.

## oq-0012 — Ratify `type-system-as-core-audit.md`: give the code plane its missing enforcement?
- status: swept
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0026.md
- blocking: false
- question: `security-planes.md` composes three planes — types enforce the **code plane**, provenance
  labels the data plane, object capabilities the boundary — but the code plane is enforced by nothing:
  no type checker is installed or configured (`pyproject.toml` has no `[tool.mypy]`; dev deps are
  pytest/ruff/hypothesis; ruff's selected families lint style, not cross-boundary type consistency).
  The sharp point (finding-0026): the project already accepts and depends on promote-runtime-invariant-
  to-static-AST-proof — `ops/import_lint.py` does exactly that for I2 — yet applies it to no other
  invariant, while two invariants slated for TLA+/Alloy treatment (label monotonicity, capability
  non-amplification) have static shadows a checker would enforce at authorship time, free. The remedy
  note `type-system-as-core-audit.md` is drafted (committed `38ccc85`, `warrant: finding-0026`) as a
  conservative extension of `security-planes.md`. Ratify it at the blessing gate (by hand, §10) so
  `/graduate` can decompose its B-items, or decline? On ratification finding-0026 flips `→ promoted`.
- default_if_unanswered: the note stays `draft` and ungraduatable; the code plane stays enforcement-free
  and every builder session mutates `core/` under a weaker guarantee than the three-plane composition
  assumes. Parks as finding-0026; re-entry — owner ratifies/declines here, or a type-consistency defect
  in `core/` that a checker would have caught at authorship surfaces in a build session.
- answer: **RATIFIED** — owner hand-edited `status: draft → ratified` (2026-07-11, the blessing
  gate proper) and directed the mypy bootstrap to begin immediately. finding-0026 flipped
  `→ promoted`. The note's B-items are now licensed: B-1 (report-only audit) executed same day;
  B-2 (gate wiring) follows once both tiers are green; B-3 (static-shadow spike) per the note.
  Swept to the origin finding same day.

## oq-0013 — Amend bp-012's write_scope with `ops/lifecycle/launcher.py` (one line) so Item 4 can register the store for reset?
- status: swept   # 2026-07-12 /triage — grant applied in bp-012 front-matter (owner-concurred comment in place); Item 4 landed + sealed; the trailing-comment parser wrinkle this exposed fixed by bp-014's §5 fold (`_scalar()`)
- origin: docs/build-plans/bp-012/plan.md §5 (scope amendment note) + §7 Item 4
- blocking: false
- question: bp-012 (B-b, the code-observation store) has Item 4 "reset registration" — the new
  `data/code_observations.sqlite` store is corpus-side (the observed stratum), so it must join
  `reset_targets()` in `ops/lifecycle/launcher.py` (Q4; the versions.sqlite/`bp-fix` sidecar precedent:
  reset targets are listed explicitly). But `ops/lifecycle/launcher.py` is NOT in bp-012's front-matter
  `write_scope` — only "the one `reset_targets()` line" is contemplated (§5 keeps the rest of
  `ops/lifecycle/**` out of scope). The plan defers the one-line scope amendment to you: add
  `"ops/lifecycle/launcher.py"` to bp-012's `write_scope`, and the builder lands Item 4 (one list entry +
  comment + an additive seed line in the existing reset test — the ONE permitted existing-test edit); or
  decline, and Item 4 parks with a finding (the store works but is NOT wiped on corpus reset until a later
  scoped plan adds it — the versions.sqlite defect class, a hygiene gap, not a correctness break).
  This is a capability grant, not a blessing gate — your call by hand on the plan front-matter (or a word
  here and the orchestrator adds the single line before spawning bp-012).
- default_if_unanswered: `ops/lifecycle/launcher.py` stays out of bp-012's write_scope; Item 4 parks with a
  finding and Items 3+5 proceed (the store + projection land; reset-registration deferred). Re-entry — owner
  adds the line (here or by hand), or a corpus reset is observed to leave `code_observations.sqlite` behind.
- answer: **YES — add it** (owner, 2026-07-11). `"ops/lifecycle/launcher.py"` added to bp-012's
  front-matter `write_scope` so Item 4 registers `data/code_observations.sqlite` in
  `reset_targets()`. Applied by the orchestrator (capability grant, not a blessing gate). This
  edit + answer were Bash-mediated: the finding-0031 pointer bleed (running bp-011 worktree
  builder set MAIN's active-plan pointer) falsely scoped the orchestrator to bp-011, so the
  Edit-tool scope-guard would deny these legitimate orchestrator writes — documented workaround
  per finding-0031's precedent. Swept when /triage runs.

## oq-0014 — Ratify `ci-platform-and-runner-strategy.md`, and rule D4 (release home = repo host)?
- status: swept   # 2026-07-12 /triage — ratification + D4(i) folded to origin finding-0034 (→ promoted); note ratified by owner hand; Plan A = bp-015 sealed, Plans B/C = bp-016/bp-017 ready
- origin: docs/design-notes/ci-platform-and-runner-strategy.md (promoted from finding-0034 + finding-0032)
- blocking: true   # the only working CI gate + the deploy-attestation path hang on it (GitLab minutes = 0)
- question: The runner/CI strategy note is drafted per your 2026-07-11 direction: GitHub Actions
  becomes the authoritative gate now (repo public → unlimited free; Gate-0 public-tree check
  CLEARED — see note §2); AWS Lambda MicroVM runners PARK on three named triggers (§4 D7);
  finding-0032's `needs:[]` closes as subsumed-by-construction (D6). Two asks: (1) ratify the
  note by hand (`status: draft → ratified`) so `/graduate` can mint Plan A (parity gate — the
  stale GitHub workflow is currently red-at-install on every mirrored main push), Plan B
  (witness re-point), Plan C (docs home). (2) Rule **D4**: `.releaserc.json`'s commit-back
  means the release host must BE the origin host — so either (i) **end-state, recommended:
  GitHub becomes origin** (release via workflow_dispatch, plugin swap, PR/branch CI unlocked),
  or (ii) **interim default: GitLab stays origin and you cut releases locally**
  (`npm run release`, zero minutes, no divergence). The diverging shape (GitHub-hosted release
  + GitLab origin) is forbidden either way.
- default_if_unanswered: the note stays draft and ungraduatable — the CI gate stays dead
  (GitLab 0 min; GitHub red-at-install), deploy stays hard-blocked (no attestable green), and
  pushing stays unconstrained. D4 defaults to (ii) interim. Parks on finding-0034; re-entry —
  owner ratifies here/by hand, or the monthly GitLab reset arrives and the metered leak resumes.
- answer: **RATIFIED + D4 = (i) END-STATE** (owner, 2026-07-11). The owner hand-flipped the
  note `draft → ratified` (the blessing gate proper) and ruled in-session: *"semantic release
  happens on the GitHub side — GitHub is shaping up to be the new home for releases and
  running CI tests."* So GitHub becomes origin per D4(i): release runs on GitHub
  (`workflow_dispatch`, witness-dispatched), `@semantic-release/gitlab → @semantic-release/github`,
  mirror reverses/retires, PR/branch CI unlocks. Plan B carries the release relocation (the
  note §5 anticipated this iff D4 ruled end-state); the origin re-point + mirror reversal are
  owner-console steps carried in Plan B as owner-steps with park conditions. Answer transcribed
  by the orchestrator (a ruling record, not a blessing gate — the gate was the owner's hand
  edit). Swept when /triage runs.

## oq-0015 — The ported `semgrep --error` gate is blocking and red on the existing tree (22 findings); keep blocking, or match GitLab's report-only parity?

- question: bp-015's first clean live CI run (sha `8d534a0`, run 29179448272) is **4/5 green** —
  `ratchet`, `type-gate` (the exact-69 mypy baseline holds on GitHub), `vault-axis` (the Vault
  service container works under host networking), and `gitleaks` all pass. **`semgrep` fails**: the
  scan completes fine (432 rules, 508 files) and reports **22 blocking findings**, and §6(f)'s
  `uvx semgrep scan --config p/default --error` makes findings fatal. The 22 are a pre-existing
  **audit backlog**, not a new regression — loopback `urllib` calls (one already `# noqa: S310`-annotated),
  internal-constant migration SQL f-strings (false-positive-in-context), two Terraform AWS hardening
  items, a Flask format-string, and — pointedly — a `mutable-action-tag` rule flagging our own
  `@v7`/`@v8.3.2` refs for not being SHA-pinned. None are exploitable sealed-core vulns. **The crux:**
  GitLab's SAST template is **report-only** (job exits 0; findings go to the MR widget), so the plan's
  deliberate `--error` choice made the GitHub gate **stricter than the original it ports**, and it was
  never verified green-on-clean before merge. I cannot resolve this in bp-015: fixing 22 code sites is
  out of scope (§9) and needs your judgment on acceptability; dropping `--error` is a gate-content change
  (§10). Three paths (detail in finding-0037): **(1) keep blocking + triage/suppress the 22** (nosemgrep
  the reviewed-intentional ones, SHA-pin actions, open follow-ups for the real hardening; code edits land
  in a separate scoped plan); **(2) match GitLab parity → report-only** (drop `--error`; restores true
  parity, loses the blocking guarantee); **(3) narrow/path-scope the ruleset** (may extend above p/default,
  never drop below it). Rule the direction (and, if (1), a suppression-policy sketch).
- default_if_unanswered: the `semgrep` job stays **parked** and red (it is one of five independent jobs —
  its red does not stop the other four greening; main's `ci` badge reads failing until ruled). bp-015 stays
  `in-progress` with semgrep parked; bp-016/bp-017 wait on bp-015's seal; deploy stays hard-blocked (no
  clean attestable green). Parks on finding-0037; re-entry — owner rules here, or a reader/witness is
  blocked by the persistently-red `semgrep` job.
- answer: **REPORT-ONLY — match GitLab parity** (owner, 2026-07-12, via AskUserQuestion). Drop
  `--error` so semgrep reports findings in the log but does not fail the pipeline — exactly the
  GitLab SAST template's non-blocking behavior; restores true parity (the `--error` blocking was
  the plan's over-reach beyond the ported original). The 22 findings are preserved in finding-0037
  as a triage backlog (not lost, not fixed here). Enacted THIS session (a gate change now
  owner-authorized, not a unilateral one): `.github/workflows/ci.yml` semgrep step → report-only;
  finding-0037 → resolved; bp-015 re-verified 5/5 green + ratchet canary, then sealed. Swept to
  origin (finding-0037) same session.

## oq-0016 — Hand-repair three formatter-mangled spans in the now-ratified `dn-self-sensing`?
- status: swept   # 2026-07-12 /triage — owner repaired by hand (3a873c2) + permanently removed the formatter; answer self-contained, origin is the note itself (no finding to fold)
- origin: docs/design-notes/self-sensing.md (the ratification save, 2026-07-12; committed verbatim as 8deab2a)
- blocking: false   # renders broken in three spots; semantics still legible — P3 graduation proceeds regardless
- question: Your ratification save ran the editor's markdown auto-formatter. Most of the pass is
  benign (emphasis restyle, table realignment — kept), but three spans corrupted where `_italics_`
  collided with the underscores in `φ_code`/`φ_self`, and one paragraph list-ified because a
  continuation line began with `+`. A8 correctly denied agent repair the moment the status flipped
  (working-tree-keyed, laundering-proof — the guard did its job), so the blessed record is frozen
  as your hand left it and the repair is yours. The three spans, as they should read (backticking
  `φ_code`/`φ_self` and replacing the line-leading `+` with "plus" makes them formatter-stable, so
  a future save won't re-mangle):

  **§3.3 B-a** (now `φ*code … \_Falsifier: … *`):

  ```
  - **B-a** — interpreter-version supersession mechanics in the observation-store family
    (additive migration; `φ_code` inherits). _Falsifier: a re-projection under a bumped
    interpreter version either mutates rows in place or is silently ignored._
  ```

  **§3.3 B-b** (now `φ*self … \_Falsifier: … *`):

  ```
  - **B-b** — `AgentSensingHandoff` + `AgentObservationStore` + `φ_self` over the cost
    stream; attested, idempotent per commit. _Falsifier: a second projection of the same
    commit changes row count; or any API surface accepts a provenance parameter._
  ```

  **Cross-references, first sentence** (now a broken bullet — rejoin to one paragraph):

  ```
  Verified in-session 2026-07-12: `core/sensing.py` (`SensingHandoff`; `CodeSensingHandoff`
  plus the Q1 sibling-precedent comment; `ObservedView` constructor-enforced observed-only);
  `core/stores/code_observations.py` (structural OBSERVED mint; `PRIMARY KEY (commit_sha,
  path, qualname)` + `INSERT OR IGNORE`; `projections` bookkeeping; SQLite Q2 note;
  ```

  (rest of that paragraph unchanged, de-indented back to column 0).
- update (2026-07-12, owner): **the markdown auto-formatter is permanently removed** — no future
  save can re-mangle. The three spans above are still owed a hand-repair (the note is ratified,
  agent-immutable), but the formatter-stability rationale is now moot: restoring the original
  spans verbatim is equally safe; the block above works either way.
- default_if_unanswered: the blessed record stays as-is — three spans render broken but read
  unambiguously; nothing downstream consumes the rendering. Re-entry: any future owner hand-edit
  of the note (fold the repair in), or the note's first supersession.
- answer: **REPAIRED BY HAND** (owner, 2026-07-12, same day). All three spans restored (§3.3
  B-a/B-b falsifiers, the Cross-references paragraph incl. its original `+` continuation —
  safe again with the formatter permanently removed), and the formatter's benign underscore
  restyling reverted to the original asterisk italics throughout. Committed verbatim by the
  orchestrator. Swept when /triage runs.

## oq-0017 — Pin a "side-effect audit before falsifier-demo runs" rule (finding-0039)? Plus a notice: your GitLab PAT was incidentally rotated.
- status: swept   # 2026-07-12 — owner accepted same day; amendment landed in build-plan SKILL.md §7, finding-0039 → promoted
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0039.md
- blocking: false
- question: bp-016's falsifier-demo run (the discipline that points a NEW test suite at
  the PRE-change module to show red) executed the old module's `rotate()` live — it
  rotated the real GitLab PAT as a side effect. Outcome benign (fail-safe ordering
  completed; no secret exposed; details in the finding), but the hazard class is real:
  pre-change code may hold live side-effecting functions, and the demo run executes
  them un-mocked. Proposed one-line amendment to the falsifier-demo discipline (lives in
  the build-plan/checkpoint skills): "before running any suite against a pre-change
  module, enumerate its live side-effecting functions and mock/skip them for the demo
  run." Ratify (or re-word) the amendment? Interim mitigation already active: the
  orchestrator now includes the side-effect audit line verbatim in every delegation
  prompt (bp-018/bp-021 onward, 2026-07-12).
  **NOTICE riding along (no action needed):** the Keychain `gitlab-api` PAT was rotated
  by that demo run — new token id 25599923, expires 2026-08-11, old value revoked
  server-side, stored + read-back verified. The plan's parked decision (you revoke the
  GitLab token at mirror retirement, Item 11c) is unchanged — there is simply a newer
  value in the same slot.
- default_if_unanswered: the prompt-level mitigation stands (orchestrator-enforced per
  delegation); the skill files stay unamended. Parks as finding-0039; re-entry — owner
  ratifies the skill amendment here, or a falsifier-demo side effect recurs despite the
  prompt line.
- answer: owner accepts

## oq-0018 — Delegated-parallel-builders + live tests: machine-global lock, scheduler policy, or accept the re-run fallback? (finding-0069)
- status: open
- origin: docs/findings/finding-0069.md
- blocking: false
- question: bp-023 landed the live-test lock (Item 12) and PROVED it correct — a
  server-log cross-reference showed exactly one endpoint cold-load during a two-process
  race, i.e. the fixture serializes two live tests in ONE worktree as designed. But
  Item 13's literal "both processes pass" flaked under a WIDER axis this plan could not
  reach: whole-machine RAM pressure from the *sibling builder worktrees* — i.e. THIS
  session's own decision to run bp-023/024/025 in parallel starved the shared physical
  Ollama daemon (server log: "predicted to exceed available memory, evicting …
  system_free=3.2 GiB"; two sibling worktrees' gate suites running concurrently). A
  single worktree's `write_scope` cannot install a lock spanning worktrees it may not
  write. So: the delegated-parallel-builders mode (now standard) introduces a
  cross-worktree, machine-capacity contention the repo-scoped lock doesn't cover. Which
  answer do you want — (a) a MACHINE-GLOBAL lock outside any worktree's write_scope
  (e.g. a scheduler-level or ~/.ollama-adjacent convention, keyed by endpoint hash,
  shared across worktrees); (b) a SCHEDULER/DELEGATE POLICY ("no two delegated builders
  run `-m live` concurrently" — a policy fix, encoded in the delegate skill, not code);
  or (c) ACCEPT the residual as the documented cost of parallel builders for the live
  tier, with finding-0046's "re-run before investigating" the permanent fallback for
  this cross-worktree case?
- default_if_unanswered: (c) — accept the fallback. Item 12's lock stands as the fix for
  the ORIGINALLY-MODELED class (one worktree's live tests racing, or a builder's suite
  overlapping the orchestrator's gate in the SAME checkout); the cross-worktree residual
  is documented and the CI gate never runs live tests anyway (`-m "not live …"`), so it
  does not gate merges. Re-entry — the live-flake tax under parallel builders becomes
  painful enough to warrant (a) or (b), or /triage promotes finding-0069 to a design note
  amending the delegate skill.

## oq-0019 — bp-031 rename-stable identity: which `doc_id` mechanism? (the A6 prerequisite)
- status: open
- origin: docs/build-plans/bp-031/plan.md §11
- blocking: false
- question: `dn-temporal-retrieval-algebra`'s A6 ruling made rename-stable note identity a HARD
  prerequisite (it gates the diachronic reader / Result-1 H1 / β\*-over-lineage), and bp-031 is the
  FIRST graduated plan. The note deliberately left the *mechanism* open ("front-matter uuid **or
  equivalent**", `supersession-lifecycle.md:290`), so graduation parked it rather than infer it (A4).
  Two grounding facts sharpen the choice: (1) the `versions` store is ALREADY keyed on a generic
  `doc_id` column (`versions.py:54`) — today `sync.py:112` just passes `source_path` as that id, so the
  version schema needs NO change; (2) `parse_note` ALREADY extracts `id::`-style properties into
  `parsed.properties` (`logseq.py:19,64`) — reading an EXISTING Logseq page id is zero-new-code and
  zero-vault-mutation. The open question is what to do when a note has no id: (A) read an existing
  `id::` when present + detect renames by EXACT-CONTENT match on rescan, and do NOT mint into the vault
  (non-mutating, deterministic, but rename+edit falls back to a new lineage); (B) MINT an `id::` into
  every note's front-matter (guarantees stability incl. rename+edit, but WRITES the owner's authored
  corpus — a vault mutation); or (C) an external-only `doc_id ↔ source_path` map with no rename
  detection (adds a store but leaves the same rename gap as A without A's content-match coverage).
  Which mechanism? (bp-031 Item 1 — the additive `doc_id := source_path` foundation — is
  mechanism-agnostic and buildable regardless; only Items 2–3, the resolution + rename carry-forward,
  wait on this.)
- default_if_unanswered: (A) — existing-`id::` + exact-content rename detection on rescan, NO
  mint-into-vault. It is deterministic, non-corpus-mutating, and exact for the common case
  (rename-without-edit); rename+edit degrades to a new lineage, which is no worse than today. Parks as
  bp-031 §11; re-entry — owner rules here at `proposed → ready`, or a measured rename+edit frequency
  warrants escalating to (B) mint-into-vault (which makes it exact but requires an explicit vault-write
  grant).
