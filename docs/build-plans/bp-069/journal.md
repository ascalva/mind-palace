# Journal — bp-069 (chat real-time + lossless: growth-aware append + a live transcript watcher)

## 2026-07-18 — minted (proposed), awaiting owner bless
Owner-directed (2026-07-18), warranted by **finding-0109**. bp-068's live verification surfaced that
`sync()` FREEZES a session once ingested (bp-063 Q4), so a session left open for hours / overnight is
captured PARTIAL and its tail is lost. Owner (emphatic): unacceptable, data loss would be common, the
system is real-time so ingestion must be IMMEDIATE — parity with the code sensor (every commit → every
transcript change). This plan makes chat ingestion growth-aware + real-time. Status `proposed` — awaits
the owner's `proposed → ready` blessing (owner-only, by hand).

**Grounding carried in the plan (so a fresh builder needn't re-derive):**
- **Change detection = the rawstore `is_new` signal** (stateless, "git for transcripts"): a growth-aware
  `sync()` `add_text`s each transcript and only re-parses when `is_new` (changed); `add_batch` is
  idempotent by `(session_id, turn_index)` so re-parsing a grown file appends ONLY the new turns. No
  sidecar state store needed. Freeze-once (Q4) removed.
- **Torn-line tolerance:** `parse_transcript` (ops/chat_sensor.py:91) has a bare `json.loads` — a live
  file read mid-append can crash. Wrap per-line in try/except JSONDecodeError (skip-and-continue).
- **Watcher:** `VaultWatcher` (core/ingest/watch.py) is already a generic debounced dir-watcher
  (watchdog→poll), independent per instance. Generalize → `DirectoryWatcher` (`vault`→`path`); repoint
  the sole caller (build_vault_watcher). `build_chat_watcher` on_change → `enqueue_chat_sync`. Small
  debounce (0.5s) for immediacy.
- **Launcher:** `Components.watcher` (single) → `watchers: list`; `_serve`/`_shutdown` iterate;
  `build_components` builds vault + chat watchers. Register `chat_sync` in `router._PINNED_KINDS`.
- **Config:** a `[chat]` section (`transcripts_dir` override + watch debounce/poll) — plain fields, ratchet
  STAYS 19. Folds finding-0108's two follow-ups (G1 transcripts_dir override, G2 _PINNED_KINDS).
- **AMENDS ratified dn-chat-sensor Q4** (owner is the design authority) + notes the whole-session-refusal
  behavior under growth (a secret in a new turn freezes the session at its pre-secret state; still
  fail-closed — bright line #10 intact).

**Architecture SETTLED (owner, 2026-07-18, over several refinements):** one source (the transcript),
projected at different rates, ALL deterministic/model-free. **bp-069 = layers 0 + 1** ("the agent projects
twice"). Layer 0 = the rich dialogue (raw snapshot + tool-stripped prose), real-time, lossless. Layer 1 =
**WHAT actions were performed** — an ordered typed ACTION LOG (`owner_prompt → commit → ratify → build_plan
→ …`) extracted deterministically from the transcript's turns + TOOL RECORDS (so it reads the FULL raw
transcript, not the tool-stripped chatlog); no prose ("for prose, read layer 0"), no model. Layer 2 (=
**WHERE** they happened — deterministic edges to the exact commit/file/doc from the same tool records,
proving causation) is the SEPARATE connector agent, **bp-070**. Corrections banked in finding-0109: NO
Track-2/strata-access (reads its own transcript only), NOT the dreamer, layer 2 is causal-not-time-join. The
abstractive model summary is a LATER rate. bp-069 has no model → #10 not in play here.

**Next action when blessed:** Item 1 (growth-aware sensor + torn-line) → Item 2 (watcher + generalization
+ multi-watcher launcher + `[chat]` config). Est opus/180k, session_budget 2. ⚠️ suite stays RED-by-design
at the ratchet 19 — acceptance = only `test_core_self_containment` fails AND count == 19; verify the vault
watcher is byte-identical post-rename; verify a live transcript change re-ingests appended turns.

## 2026-07-18 (session-28, FABLE) — RE-MINTED as Phase Β: the dialogue sensor agent, born scoped
Owner sequenced "algebra leads" → the plan is rewritten under the ratified-pending `dn-agent-taxonomy`
(§2.4 sensor role, §3 Phase Β): same three items (L0 lossless growth-aware + torn-line + TOTAL
accounting; DirectoryWatcher + multi-watcher launcher; L1 action log `chat_events`), now +
`depends_on: bp-070` (consumes D2's `sensor_scope(DIALOGUE)` + conformance test), + the parity gauge
(explains the 203-files-vs-110-sessions delta), + the snapshot insurance noted
(`data/backup-staging/transcripts-snapshot-2026-07-18.tar.gz`, 203 files/60MB — tails recoverable).
Integrator renumbered bp-070→**bp-071** (bp-070 = Phase Α scope tooling). Status stays `proposed`;
bless meaningful after Α seals (or at the owner's discretion now — build order enforced by depends_on).
